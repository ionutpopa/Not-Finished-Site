# Sample Website

I made this website as a sample for anyone who want some of the css styling it has.
In making of this website I used pure CSS, HTML and Javascript.
The slider is made with swiperjs, a very good tool for making sliders and it's very customizable.
The background has a nice video on loop that in my opinion makes the whole website look better!
I made a small js file that I think it can help some beginners understand what javascript can do.
